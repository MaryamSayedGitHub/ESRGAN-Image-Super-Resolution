# ESRGAN Super Resolution with Streamlit 🚀

This project leverages **Enhanced Super-Resolution Generative Adversarial Networks (ESRGAN)** to perform high-quality image upscaling. The backend is built using the ESRGAN model for image super-resolution, and the application is deployed using **Streamlit** for a simple and interactive web interface.

## 🛠️ Requirements

Before you start, make sure you have the following Python libraries installed:

- `streamlit` 📊
- `torch` ⚡ (PyTorch for ESRGAN model)
- `Pillow` 🖼️ (for image processing)
- `opencv-python` 🎥 (for image handling)

You can install these dependencies using `pip`:

```bash
pip install streamlit torch pillow opencv-python
```
